	How do I construct the world? Why do I construct the field this way? Waht could be missing out? Where is my information source? 
		I try to be as Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) as possible. In terms or geographically, in terms of temporally, in terms of conceptually, in terms of the field it self. When searching we have to understood that, the information that is presented to us had been a history, the knowledge of the past. In order to be collectively exhaustive, we need to as much as possible make it timely. 

When thinking about why you should or want to learn a subjects and learn a skill, look at how it could be apply practically, if not at least how it could help you comprehend the world conceptually.
