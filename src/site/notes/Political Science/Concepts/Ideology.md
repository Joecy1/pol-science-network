# Ideology

- Not every -ism is ideology. Ideologies map the political and social worlds for us.
- The substance of ideology provide both the commonalities and variations, a complex and rich world
- A political ideology is a set of ideas, beliefs, opinions, and values that
	- (1) exhibit a recurring pattern
	- (2) are held by significant groups
	- (3) compete over providing and controlling plans for public policy
	- (4) do so with the aim of justifying, contesting or changing the social and political arrangements and processes of a political community.

- Ideologies are complex combinations and clusters of political concepts in sustainable patterns.
- An ideology is a wide-ranging structural arrangement that attributes meaning to a range of mutually defining political concepts.
- An ideology is a wide-ranging structural arrangement that attributes decongested meanings to a range of mutually defining political concepts.
- Ideologies compete over the control of political language as well as competing over plans for public policy; indeed, their competition over plans for public policy is primarily conducted through their competition over the control of political language.
- The study of ideology can also be recognized as the study of actual political thought - the concrete thinking of political communities and within political communities.
- To explore ideologies is to penetrate the heart of politics, and it requires a sympathetic student, not a dismissive or a disillusioned one. Politics is principally concerned with making collective decisions and with the regulation of conflict that both precedes and follows such decisions. Thinking about politics is always thinking defined by, and channeled in, those directions.
