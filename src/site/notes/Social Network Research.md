Robins, Garry. 2015. _Doing Social Network Research: Network-Based Research Design for Social Scientists_. Los Angeles: SAGE. [Libby]

- This book talks about the nature of network research to aid those research that deals with actor and tie. It begins with the fundamental concepts in network theory and then the practical part of it. Those are observation, measurement, data collection, ethical issue, visualization and analytic method.

> We live life in the network. ... Each of these transactions leaves digital breadcrumbs which, when pulled together, offer increasingly comprehensive pictures of both individuals and groups, with the potential of transforming our understanding of our lives, organizations, and societies in a fashion that was barely conceivable just a few years ago.
> Lazer et al. (2009 721)

- A social network has social actors: they are involved in action in some way, often with motivations and strategies.
- The nodes represent the actors in the study; the line between the two nodes is network tie.
