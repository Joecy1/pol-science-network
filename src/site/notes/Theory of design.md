## THE EVALUATION OF DESIGNS 
1. Theory of evaluation: utility theory, statistical decision theory 
2. Computational methods: 
	 a. Algorithms for choosing optimal alternatives such as linear programming computations, control theory, dynamic programming 
	 b. Algorithms and heuristics for choosing satisfactory alternatives 

1. THE FORMAL LOGIC OF DESIGN: imperative and declarative logics 
## THE SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVES 
2. Heuristic search: factorization and means-ends analysis 
3. Allocation of resources for search 
4. THEORY OF STRUCTURE AND DESIGN ORGANIZATION: hierarchic systems 
5. REPRESENTATION OF DESIGN PROBLEMS

- “Design, on the other hand, is concerned with how things ought to be, with devising artifacts to attain goals.” (Simon, 2008, p. 126)
- “a process of cyclical interaction between painter and canvas” (Simon, 2008, p. 175)
- “the task of science is to make use of the world's redundancy to describe that world simply.” (Simon, 2008, p. 221)

- Designing without final goals and two desideratum for social planning
- We should design without final goals because the exposure to design and new experiences can generate new goals and activity. "Each step of implementation created a new situation; and the new situation provided starting point for fresh design activity." (Simon, 2008, p. 175) Instead of thinking final goal, we can think of starting point as the destination of designing. "The real result of our actions is to establish initial conditions for the next succeeding stage of action. What we call "final" goals are in fact criteria for choosing the initial conditions that we will leave to our successors."

1. “One desideratum would be a world offering as many alternatives as possible to future decision makers, avoiding irreversible commitments that they cannot undo.” (Simon, 2008, p. 175)
2. “A second desideratum is to leave the next generation of decision makers with a better body of knowledge and a greater capacity for experience.” (Simon, 2008, p. 175)
