### Self Notes

#### Differences between, ideologies, theory, and philosophies

Intellectual construction of human mind with different functions for describing and dealing with political relationships

Theorist
	Observes, discover patterns understand and explain it
	Analyzes strategies and assesses performances
	True and define
	Judged its elegance, its clarity, its explanatory power
	
Philosopher
	As a whole, abstract
	How everything fits together
	Judged by its comprehensiveness, its conviction, its sublimity
	
Ideologies
	Combat and perform
	Must be doing it - with a shorthand guide to action
	Simple and concrete for it to be effective
	Judged by its utility
	
How ideologies relates to theories and philosopher?
Machiavelli, Tocqueville, and J. S. Mill
	Observers of the game of politics, well-ordered statements and couched in general terms.
	Behavior in actual political situations and not universal statements about human life

Montesquieu, Locke, and Hume
	Probed deep into the origin of our ideas about justice, human motivations and political arrangement
	
Aristotle, Hobbes and Marx
	What can we learn from Aristotle political theory
		makes direct statements about what goes on in politics, provides us with the vocabulary and categories for understanding the game, and engages in a complex and fruitful analysis of what is going on.

Plato, Rousseau, and Hegel
	Going to the roots of human life, to understand our most fundamental dilemmas and possibilities, to penetrate behind appearances to a truer reality
	This radical penetration - either require long training in philosophy (Plato), hours of solitary reflection (Rosseau), critical reflection on the works of earlier philosophers (Marx)
	Understand political life not as it now is, but in potential
	entirely new dimension of political possibility and postulates the radical insufficiency of the old familiar game
