> abstract:: "Why do we remember the past and not the future? What does it mean for time to "flow"? Do we exist in time or does time exist in us? In lyric, accessible prose, Carlo Rovelli invites us to consider questions about the nature of time that continue to puzzle physicists and philosophers alike. He tears down our assumptions about time one by one, revealing a strange universe where at the most fundamental level time disappears. He explains how the theory of quantum gravity attempts to understand and give meaning to the resulting extreme landscape of this timeless world. Weaving together ideas from philosophy, science and literature, he suggests that our perception of the flow of time depends on our perspective, better understood starting from the structure of our brain and emotions than from the physical universe. Already a bestseller in Italy, and written with the poetic vitality that made Seven Brief Lessons on Physics so appealing, The Order of Time offers a profoundly intelligent, culturally rich, novel appreciation of the mysteries of time."--Dust jacket

### Self Notes


Physics can have an effect of how we understand the world, there are questions understood by philosophy before we have tools and methods to study empirically or scientifically. Two of the most important studies, I think is time and light, both has an effect on how we understand the world, the cause and effect of things. 

Thermodynamics is not a true description of the system; it is a description of these variables of the system, those through which we assume we are able to interact with the system.

It uses the cards combination to illustrate why time flows from past to the future. 

This is why I have been fascinating at probabilities and quantum computer. What is the probabilities that I am born in a male body, a chinese ethnic, friends with certain group of people, come into being where I am now.

## Reading notes


### 6. The World Is Made of Events, Not Things

>We understand the world by studying change, not by studying things. A war is not a thing, it's a sequence of events. A storm is not a thing, it's a collection of occurrences. A family is not a thing, it is a collection of relations, occurrences, feelings.

> It is a complex process, where food, information, light, words and so on enter and exitâ€¦. A knot of knots in a network of social relations, in a network of chemical processes, in a network of emotions exchanged with its own kind.

>Thinking of the world as a collection of events, of processes, is the way that allows us to better grasp, comprehend, and describe it. It is the only way that is compatible with relativity. The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.

>Things persist in time; events have a limited duration.

>The world is made up of networks of kisses, not of stones
### 10. Perspective

> Not all the variables of the world interact with us, or with the segment of the world to which we belong. Only a very minute fraction of these variables does so; most of them do not react with us at all. They do not register us, and we do not register them. The physical interaction between myself and a glass of water, two pieces of the world, is independent of the motion of the single molecules of water. Our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. The entropy of the world does not depend only on the configuration of the world; [it] depends on the way in which we are blurring the world....Speed is a property of an object with respect to another object. It is a relative quantity. The same is true for entropy.

>Indexicality: the characteristic of certain words that have a different meaning every time they are used, a meaning determined by where, how, when, and by whom they are being spoken.

### 11. What Emerges from a Particularity

> He exaggerates, of course, because the fact that there are no causes at an elementary level is not a sufficient reason to render obsolete the very notion of cause. At an elementary level there are no cats either, but we do not for this reason cease to bother with cats. The low entropy of the past renders the notion of cause an effective one.

> [C]ausality, memory, traces, the history of the happening of the world itself can only be an effect of perspective: like the turning of the heavens; an effect of our peculiar point of view in the world.

> The existence of common causes in the past is nothing but a manifestation of low entropy in the past.

> Life is this network of processes for increasing entropy, processes that act as catalysts to each other.

> The flame is a process that opens a channel through which the wood can pass into a state of higher entropy.

> Inside every living cell, the complex web of chemical processes is a structure that opens and closes gates through which low entropy can increase.

### 12. The Scent of the Madeleine

> Time, then, is the form in which we beings, whose brains are made up essentially of memory and foresight, interact with the world: it is the source of our identity, and of our suffering as well.

> It's suffering because we must lose what we have and are attached to. Because everything that begins must end. What causes us to suffer is not in the past or the future: it is here, now, in our memory, in our expectations. We long for timelessness, we endure the passing of time: we suffer time. Time is suffering.
