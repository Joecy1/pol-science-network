When building this place, we have one thing in mind - value creation. But what is value in the first place? Value creation for an academics means pushing the frontier of knowledge, looking for gaps in existing knowledge be it the results, the methods, the inferences, the interpretation and then seek to reconfigure or integrate them in a way that has never done before. 

Value creation means that this website look at the existing player in the field and bring to you the review of them but the the copycat version of them. This website seek to build trust. When it has opinions, it does so with rigor analysis and synthesis. We believe there are a lot of great things out there. We are here to build tribe, a tribe that ought to challenge the popular view of politics. Good governance and Wellbeing is something that we championed. They can come in various forms so does the people colours, interests, likes and dislikes.


Value can be qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative is equality, freedom, 

SDG, ESG, Women equality,  

Value is a big topics, we do not act as if we could give you the exhaustive view of it. 

Value, for the admin, means to sit and chat with friends that simple. Value means peace. Value can be define by corporate or by the users.
