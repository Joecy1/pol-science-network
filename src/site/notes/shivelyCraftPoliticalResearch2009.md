> Any variables we would choose to measure these concepts correspond only indirectly or in part to our mental constructs. This is the basic problem of measurement in the social sciences.

> The best we can do in measuring it is to combine the various measurable indicators into a pooled measure

> For a concept to be useful in building theories, it usually must be an abstraction, which cannot be measured directly. 

> [!quote|yellow]+ Highlight ([page. 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QQN5BWXX?page=28&annotation=WFIIG8WM))
> The chief problem of measurement is to ensure, as much as possible, that the relationships between concepts and measures are such that the relationship between the measures mirrors the relationship between the concepts.

> A measure is reliable to the extent that it gives the same result again and again if the measurement is repeated.

> There are many sources of unreliability in social science data.
