    - Go out and create a community in which you will like to live in! Life is about a mix of every aspect of things. Design how you would like to create the communities around you what kind of people you would like to keep around, how do you choose to be authentic.
        Instead of reactively waiting for people to invite you, go and create and form a space, an environment where people will thrive in it.

            - Why do I make this part of the economic forces instead of the usual demand supply - Technology and capital are brother in arms. they will grow together. The future, I perceived is not based on how many demand that the government created, but how many innovation that the people truly want to have and give them the social resources. Money is simply a form of the social resources. the society will reward whoever create most value for it.

- You will be the best you if you choose to be you. The world have its problem. How you will need to do is to get good, get better, you can act as an individual, or you can act as an institutions.
- What matters is change for the good, even 1% is enough. 1% compound over time will be great amount.
